# UFOs

## Project Overview

The purpose of this this project is to help Dana in creating a webpage using HTML and Javascript visualize and organize the reported sightings in an interactice manner. To enable users, to access data of reported sightings in each city or time they choose. We used the CSS to design the page to make it more appealing and enagaging to the users.

## Summary
- The search field is "case-sensitive". The table will not update unless you enter the search criteria exactly how the data is stored. Partial entries would not work. 

- There is no button to click or wording that tells the user that the table will update after you hit "enter". 

- The data is limited and outdated since it is not linked to a "live" source.
